## Introduction

The React Minesweeper game is a single-player puzzle game designed to challenge your strategic 
thinking and analytical skills. The game board comprises a grid of cells, concealing hidden mines 
beneath some of them. Your objective is to navigate through the grid, revealing cells without 
detonating any mines. Utilize the numerical hints provided by neighboring cells to identify 
safe zones and progress through the game.

## Features

- **Responsive Interface**: The game boasts a responsive and intuitive user interface, ensuring a seamless gaming experience across various devices and screen sizes.

- **Customizable Board**: Enjoy the flexibility to customize the game board's dimensions (height and width) according to your preferences.

- **Adjustable Difficulty**: Tailor the challenge level by adjusting the count of mines, offering varying difficulty levels for players of all skill levels.

- **Intuitive Controls**: Use simple left-click to reveal cells and right-click to flag suspected mine locations, facilitating smooth and straightforward gameplay.

- **Interactive Settings**: Access interactive controls to restart the game or fine-tune settings to match your desired gameplay experience.

## Code Structure

### Components Overview

1. **App Component**: The root component that renders the `Game` component, initiating the game interface.

2. **Game Component**: Orchestrates the game by rendering the `Board` component and providing controls for game settings and restart.

3. **Board Component**: Handles the game board grid, including cell creation, interaction, mine placement, and game logic.

4. **Cell Component**: Represents individual cells within the game grid, displaying their state and handling user interactions.

### Code Highlights

- **Dynamic Grid Creation**: The `Board` component dynamically generates the game grid based on specified dimensions
- (height and width). It randomly distributes mines across the grid, ensuring a challenging and unique gameplay experience with each new game.

- **Cell Interaction**: The `Cell` component manages the behavior of individual cells, such as revealing cell content,
- flagging potential mine locations, and displaying numerical hints based on adjacent mines.

- **Game Logic**: The `Board` component houses essential game logic, including handling left-click and right-click events, revealing
- neighboring cells, flagging/unflagging cells, and determining win/loss conditions.

- **Responsive UI**: The user interface is designed to be responsive and visually appealing, providing an enjoyable gaming experience
- across various devices and screen sizes. The CSS styling (`App.css`, `Board.css`, `Cell.css`) contributes to the overall aesthetic and interactivity of the game.



### Further Development

Future iterations may involve enhancements such as:

- Implementing additional game features, such as timers or multiple difficulty levels.
- Refactoring code for improved performance or readability.
- Extending the UI with animations or theme customization options.
- Adding more comprehensive testing coverage to ensure bug-free gameplay.

## About the Developer

As a seasoned professional programmer, I have crafted this Minesweeper game using 
React to demonstrate proficiency in web development, front-end technologies, and software engineering 
practices. This project showcases my ability to create engaging and functional applications, combining 
technical expertise with a user-centric design approach.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-minesweeper.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

    ```bash
    cd react-minesweeper
    ```

3. Install dependencies using npm or yarn.

    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```

## Usage

To launch the game, execute the following command:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This command will open the game in your default browser, allowing you to embark on a challenging Minesweeper adventure.

## Game Rules

- **Left Click**: Use left-click to reveal a cell and uncover its content.
- **Right Click**: Employ right-click to flag cells suspected of containing mines, aiding in strategic gameplay.
- **Numerical Clues**: Numbers displayed in revealed cells indicate the number of adjacent mines, providing valuable hints to navigate through the grid.
- **Victory**: Successfully reveal all non-mine cells to emerge victorious.
- **Defeat**: Revealing a mine ends the game.
